Thou shalt remain here, whether thou wilt or no
I am a spirit of no common rate
The summer still doth tend upon my state
And I do love thee: therefore, go with me
I'll give thee fairies to attend on thee
And they shall fetch thee jewels from the deep
And sing while thou on pressed flowers dost sleep
And I will purge thy mortal grossness so
That thou shalt like an airy spirit go
Peaseblossom! Cobweb! Moth! and Mustardseed
Be kind and courteous to this gentleman
Hop in his walks and gambol in his eyes
Feed him with apricocks and dewberries
With purple grapes, green figs, and mulberries
The honey-bags steal from the humble-bees
And for night-tapers crop their waxen thighs
And light them at the fiery glow-worm's eyes
To have my love to bed and to arise
And pluck the wings from Painted butterflies
To fan the moonbeams from his sleeping eyes
Nod to him, elves, and do him courtesies
Come, wait upon him; lead him to my bower
The moon methinks looks with a watery eye
And when she weeps, weeps every little flower
Lamenting some enforced chastity
Tie up my love's tongue bring him silently
Welcome, good Robin
See'st thou this sweet sight
Her dotage now I do begin to pity
For, meeting her of late behind the wood,
Seeking sweet favours from this hateful fool
I did upbraid her and fall out with her
For she his hairy temples then had rounded
With a coronet of fresh and fragrant flowers
And that same dew, which sometime on the buds
Was wont to swell like round and orient pearls
Stood now within the pretty flowerets' eyes
Like tears that did their own disgrace bewail
When I had at my pleasure taunted her
And she in mild terms begg'd my patience
I then did ask of her her changeling child
Which straight she gave me, and her fairy sent
To bear him to my bower in fairy land
And now I have the boy, I will undo
This hateful imperfection of her eyes
And, gentle Puck, take this transformed scalp
From off the head of this Athenian swain
That, he awaking when the other do
May all to Athens back again repair
And think no more of this night's accidents
But as the fierce vexation of a dream
But first I will release the fairy queen
Be as thou wast wont to be
See as thou wast wont to see
Dian's bud o'er Cupid's flower
Hath such force and blessed power
Now, my Titania; wake you, my sweet queen
Now, until the break of day
Through this house each fairy stray
To the best bride-bed will we
Which by us shall blessed be
And the issue there create
Ever shall be fortunate
So shall all the couples three
Ever true in loving be
And the blots of Nature's hand
Shall not in their issue stand
Never mole, hare lip, nor scar
Nor mark prodigious, such as are
Despised in nativity
Shall upon their children be
With this field-dew consecrate
Every fairy take his gait
And each several chamber bless
Through this palace, with sweet peace
And the owner of it blest
Ever shall in safety rest
Trip away; make no stay
Meet me all by break of day
Now the hungry lion roars
And the wolf behowls the moon
Whilst the heavy ploughman snores
All with weary task fordone
Now the wasted brands do glow
Whilst the screech-owl, screeching loud
Puts the wretch that lies in woe
In remembrance of a shroud
Now it is the time of night
That the graves all gaping wide
Every one lets forth his sprite
In the church-way paths to glide
And we fairies, that do run
By the triple Hecate's team
From the presence of the sun
Following darkness like a dream
Now are frolic: not a mouse
Shall disturb this hallow'd house
I am sent with broom before
To sweep the dust behind the door
